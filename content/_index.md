        I am a Ph.D. candidate working on modeling cognitive styles expressed through personal discourse using large language models. I am broadly interested in using NLP and data science to study social/psychological phenomena through language use, annotations and active learning, and improving conversational AI, especially for mental health.
        I am always looking for opportunities to work with teams with similar interests. Please reach out to collaborate ðŸ˜ƒ
